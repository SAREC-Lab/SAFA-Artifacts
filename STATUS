The following artifacts are part of the provided artifact package:

1. Data collected from our GitHub code repository and JIRA (Software management tool) in JSON format for two different versions of the Dronology system.
2. This data is then used to generate the Artifact Trees for each version of Dronology which are provided as both Image files (.png) and Graphviz (.gv) files.
3. Based on these Artifact Trees, change analysis from version 0 to version 1 is performed and a set of Delta Trees is generated. 
   Again, this set of delta trees is shared as Image Files and Graphviz files.
   
We provide further instructions and details in the readme.md file.


The artifacts we provide are publicly available (via github) and are carefully documented.
We provide image files for quickly reviewing the artifacts, and we further provide Graphviz files and 
JSON files that can be reused, easliy parsed, and analyzed.

We therefore aim for the Reusable and Available badge.
